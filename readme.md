# Mining components price scrapper

This is a website written in NodeJS and Javascript, developed to monitor the prices of computer parts related to mining that are in high demand (Graphics cards and power supplies). It will scrap the websites of the main retailers on Brazil that sell computer parts and compile a list, with filters and alerts, on the available products. 

This was developed as a hobby, therefore the code is not well optimized and it uses some non optimal libraries such as jQuery and jQuery UI.
